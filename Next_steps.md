# Implementation Complete! ✅

## Your Requirements

### ✅ 1. Three Operation Modes
**Implemented** - Available in AI menu

- **🖥️ Terminal Only**: Always execute as shell commands (no AI)
- **🤖 AI Prompt Only**: Always convert to commands using AI
- **🔀 Hybrid (Auto-detect)**: Smart detection of natural language vs commands (default)

**How to switch**: Menu → AI → Operation Mode

### ✅ 2. Inline Command Approval
**Implemented** - No more modals!

When AI generates a command, it appears as a special **pending block** in the terminal with inline buttons:
- ✅ **Execute**: Run the command immediately
- ✏️ **Edit**: Put command in input for editing
- 🔄 **Regenerate**: Ask AI for a different command
- ❌ **Cancel**: Dismiss the suggestion

The block shows:
- 💭 Your original natural language request (italics)
- 🤖 AI-suggested command (editable)
- Orange border to indicate pending state

### ✅ 3. Standard Bash Output
**Already working!** 

All commands (whether you type them or AI generates them) execute through the same shell executor:
- Real-time streaming output
- ANSI color support
- Exit codes displayed
- Same bash output you'd see in any terminal

## How to Test

```bash
# 1. Start Ollama with a model
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:3b

# 2. Run immaterium
cargo run

# 3. In the UI:
# a) Open AI Panel: Menu → AI → Toggle AI Panel
# b) Load Models button, select qwen2.5-coder:3b
# c) Set operation mode: Menu → AI → Operation Mode → Choose one

# 4. Test each mode:
```

### Mode 1: Terminal Only
```
# Type regular commands, they execute directly
ls -la
git status
```

### Mode 2: AI Prompt Only
```
# Everything goes through AI
show me all python files
find large files
```

### Mode 3: Hybrid (Recommended)
```
# Shell commands execute directly
ls -la

# Natural language converts to commands
show me all log files over 1MB

# You get inline approval UI with buttons
```

## Architecture Changes

### New Files Modified
1. **`src/config/schema.rs`**: Added `OperationMode` enum
2. **`src/core/block.rs`**: Added `BlockState::PendingApproval` and `original_input` field
3. **`src/ui/block_widget.rs`**: Inline approval UI for pending blocks
4. **`src/ui/app.rs`**: 
   - 3-mode command routing
   - Inline block approval handlers
   - Mode switcher in AI menu
   - Removed modal dialogs

### Key Features
- **Smart NL Detection**: Checks for question words, shell patterns, common commands
- **Inline Workflow**: No popups, everything in the terminal flow
- **Fully Editable**: Can edit AI suggestions before running
- **Regenerate**: Don't like the suggestion? Get a new one
- **Real-time**: All output streams in real-time, just like bash

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Streaming AI Responses**: Show chunks as they arrive (currently non-streaming)
2. **Explain Command**: Right-click blocks to get AI explanations
3. **Auto Error Analysis**: Failed commands trigger AI suggestions for fixes
4. **Agent Mode**: AI can execute multiple commands autonomously to solve problems

**Status**: MVP Complete and Ready! 🚀

All your requirements from the original Next_steps.md have been implemented. The terminal now has a polished UX with inline approvals and three operation modes.
